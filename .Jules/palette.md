## 2025-02-23 - Interactive Dock Accessibility
**Learning:** `framer-motion` components often obscure underlying semantic elements. Using conditional rendering to swap `motion.div` wrappers with semantic `Link` or `button` elements (while preserving layout/animation props) is crucial for keyboard accessibility.
**Action:** When animating interactive elements, always ensure the root interactive element is semantic (`<button>` or `<a>`) and carries the necessary event handlers and ARIA attributes, even if it requires refactoring the animation wrapper.
