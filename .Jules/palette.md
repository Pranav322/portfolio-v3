## 2025-02-23 - Interactive Dock Accessibility

**Learning:** `framer-motion` components often obscure underlying semantic elements. Using conditional rendering to swap `motion.div` wrappers with semantic `Link` or `button` elements (while preserving layout/animation props) is crucial for keyboard accessibility.
**Action:** When animating interactive elements, always ensure the root interactive element is semantic (`<button>` or `<a>`) and carries the necessary event handlers and ARIA attributes, even if it requires refactoring the animation wrapper.

## 2025-02-23 - Tooltips for Keyboard Focus
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons often rely on hover tooltips for context, leaving keyboard users guessing. Adding `onFocus`/`onBlur` handlers to show the same tooltip on focus bridges this gap without visual clutter.
**Action:** When creating tooltips for icon-only elements, trigger visibility on `hover || focus` and ensure the interactive element itself (not just the inner icon) handles the focus events.

## 2025-05-15 - Tooltip Positioning in Mapped Lists
**Learning:** Using a single `useRef` for positioning tooltips in a mapped list causes the tooltip to always anchor to the last rendered item.
**Action:** For list items, avoid `ref` based positioning. Instead, capture `event.currentTarget.getBoundingClientRect()` in the click/hover handler and store the coordinates in state to position the tooltip dynamically.
