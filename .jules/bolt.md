## 2025-03-08 - Optimized React Component Re-renders\n**Learning:** In a highly interactive UI with heavy Framer Motion components (like a fisheye dock or draggable desktop icons), passing unmemoized event handlers or objects (e.g., `handleWallpaperChange`, `links` arrays) from parent components like `Home` or `Navbar` causes expensive cascading re-renders. Wrapping child components in `React.memo` and memoizing props with `useCallback` and `useMemo` prevents this layout thrashing.\n**Action:** Always memoize arrays/objects and callback functions passed as props to heavy animated components, and use `React.memo` to isolate their render cycles.
